  <h3>WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO CLAIM TAX TREATY BENEFITS UNDER FORM W-8BEN?</h3>
  <span>
    Individuals meeting both of the following conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>You are NOT a US citizen or other US person (such as a resident alien)</li>
      <li>You did not perform services *</li>
    </ul>
  </span>

  <h3>WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF CLAIMING TAX TREATY BENEFITS UNDER FORM W-8BEN?</h3>
  <span>If you are a foreign person, non-resident alien or foreign national who is not performing services*, Topcoder will withhold taxes on the payment. You may claim exemption from or reduction of the rate that will be withheld for taxes, if there is an applicable income tax treaty, by completing the necessary parts of Form W-8BEN.</span>
  <span>NOTE: TOPCODER CANNOT ADVISE YOU ON THE EXISTENCE OF AN INCOME TAX TREATY. FURTHERMORE, TOPCODER CANNOT ASSIST YOU IN DETERMINING YOUR ABILITY TO CLAIM A REDUCED RATE OF, OR EXEMPTION FROM, WITHHOLDING. ONCE A MEMBER CLAIMING THE BENEFIT OF A REDUCED TAX WITHHOLDING RATE PURSUANT TO A TAX TREATY PROVIDES ALL NECESSARY FORMS AND INFORMATION TO TOPCODER, TOPCODER WILL MAKE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED.</span>

  <h3>HOW DO I CLAIM TAX TREATY BENEFITS UNDER FORM W-8BEN?</h3>
  <span>W-8BEN tax forms will be processed with the standard default 30% tax withholding percentage unless they are properly completed. All members completing the W-8BEN are required to fill out at least the following boxes:</span>
  <span>
    In Part I:
    <ul>
      <li>Box 1 - Name</li>
      <li>Box 3 - Type of Beneficial Owner</li>
      <li>Box 4 - Permanent Residence Address</li>
      <li>Box 5 - Mailing Address (if different from Box 4)</li>
    </ul>
  </span>

  <span>In Part IV: Sign and date the form</span>
  <span>If a member wishes to claim the applicability of a withholding percentage of less than 30% pursuant to a tax treaty between their country of residence and the United States, then additional information must be provided. At a minimum, the member would need to provide the following additional information:</span>

  <span>
    In Part I:
    <ul>
      <li>Box 6 - US Taxpayer ID number</li>
    </ul>
  </span>

  <span>
  In Part II:
    <ul>
      <li>Box 9(a) - provide your country of residence</li>
      <li>Box 10:</li>
      <li>Specify the number of the Article of the treaty between the United States and your country of residence under which you are claiming benefit of the lower withholding percentage;</li>
      <li>Specify the lower withholding percentage you are claiming;</li>
      <li>Specify the type of income on which you are claiming the lower withholding percentage; and</li>
      <li><Provide a brief explanation of your reasoning for why you feel you are entitled to claim the lower withholding percentage pursuant to the applicable Article of the applicable treaty./li>
      <li>Please note you will need to provide a separate W-8BEN for each different type of income on which you are claiming a lower withholding percentage. Topcoder will make an independent assessment of the W-8BEN based on the information provided. A failure to provide the appropriate and accurate information in claiming a lower withholding percentage pursuant to a tax treaty will result in a default 30% tax withholding percentage.</li>
    </ul>
  </span>

  <h3>TAXES WITHHELD FOR MEMBERS COMPLETING FORM W-8BEN:</h3>

  <span>
    Taxes will be withheld from the following payment types for those members who have submitted a Form W-8BEN:
    <ul>
      <li>Data Science/Algorithm Prizes (SRMs, tournaments, or other similar challenges)</li>
      <li>Royalties</li>
      <li>Referral Bonuses</li>
      <li>Certain Digital Run bonuses (the portion of Digital Run bonus earned on submissions which did not place in 1st or 2nd place of the contest)</li>
    </ul>
  </span>

  <span>
    *For purposes of determining which tax form is required from members, Topcoder interprets “performing services” to include all services and competitions in which the member assigns ownership of the winning submission in exchange for compensation. (1) See IRS Notice 2001-4 (as of 8/21/13);
